ANT COLONY - STAGE ONE SIM ONLY
------------------------------------
prompt:
	Spawn X amount of ants
	they walk around randomly laying out a home trail when they see nothing interesting.
	if they encounter food they take it, then look for a home trail. and follow the home trail while laying downa food trail
	
	once the ant has delivered the food, it starts looking for a food trail if possible, and follows that.
	if there are competing trails the ant selects the strongest one
	
	trails decay over time
