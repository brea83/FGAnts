ANT COLONY - STAGE ONE SIM ONLY
------------------------------------
prompt:
	Spawn X amount of ants
	they walk around randomly laying out a home trail when they see nothing interesting.
	if they encounter food they take it, then look for a home trail. and follow the home trail while laying downa food trail
	
	once the ant has delivered the food, it starts looking for a food trail if possible, and follows that.
	if there are competing trails the ant selects the strongest one
	
	trails decay over time

------------------- ant goals
Flee				activates if InDanger
Bring Food to Nest	activates if HasFood and Not IsHungry
Satisfy Hunger		activates if IsHungry
Socialize			active if IsLonely

internal state
	HasFood	   : bool
	IsHungry   : bool
	IsLonely   : bool
	InDanger   : bool

	DestinationTile : tile ref

actions:

Select Next Tile
requires: none
costs: none
Results: set destination tile

move To New Tile 
requires: Select Next Tile & IsCenteredOnTile
costs: (tile move cost)
Results: set IsMoving true until destination reached
